      <h1>Step 4: Currying</h1>

      <p>With a concept called currying (also created by Haskell Curry), we can transform functions with any
         number of arguments into a chain of functions each taking only one.
      </p>
      <p>So if we have a function like this:</p>
      <pre>
function f (x, y) {
   ...
};
      </pre>
      <p>Which is called like this:</p>
      <pre>
f(x, y);
      </pre>

      <p>We can transform it, using currying, into a function like this:</p>
      <pre>
function F (x) { return function (y) {
   ...
}};
      </pre>
      <p>And call it like this:</p>
      <pre>
F(x)(y);
      </pre>

      <p>The transformed function chains it's input into multiple returns of subsequent functions. This
         is a very poweful tool when used with higher-order functions, because it allows the programmer to
         create dynamic toolchains made up of smaller functions working together as opposed to one static
         function which takes a specific input.
      </p>
