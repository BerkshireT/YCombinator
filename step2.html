      <h1>Step 2: Abstract the Recursive Call</h1>

      <p>We want to transform the regular recursive function to contain no references to itself. This allows
         for proper abstractions for the Y Combinator to do its work.
      </p>
      <p>In order to do this, we need to remove the call to 'factorial()' in the factorial function:</p>

      <pre>
function factorial(f, x) {
   return x < 1 ? 1 : x * f(f, x - 1);
}
      </pre>
      <p>This is done by abstracting the call to factorial with an assumption that the function will be passed
         another higher-order function that contains the same recursive logic as the traditional factorial. So we are assuming
         the function 'f' contains 'return x < 1 ? 1 : x * f(f, x - 1);'
      </p>

      <p>But the function 'f' doesn't exist in factorial, right? How can we recurse without defining factorial again?
         In order for this function to actually be able to recurse, we need a helper function:</p>
      <pre>
function helper (recurser, x) {
   return recurser(recurser, x);
}
      </pre>

      <p>We can call this function like so:</p>
      <pre>
helper(factorial, 7) // returns 120         
      </pre>
      <p>The helper funciton immediately returns the function called to it with the function invocation. Since we 
         pass the factorial function to itself in the helper, this allows the missing 'f' function above to be filled
         in with itself. This effectively creates recursion where otherwise not possible since the helper will only
         truly "return" once the computations for the factorial have bubbled up following the base case.
      </p>
